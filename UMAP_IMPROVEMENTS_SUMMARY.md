# UMAP Visualization Improvements Summary

## Problem Addressed
The UMAP visualizations in your thesis were not clearly visible due to their small size (0.32\textwidth each), making it difficult to see the important details of embedding space changes across different model variants.

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Increased Figure Size**
- **Before**: 0.32\textwidth (small, cramped layout with 3 figures per row)
- **After**: 0.48\textwidth (larger, clearer layout with 2 figures per row)

### 2. **Improved Layout Structure**
- **Before**: All 5 figures crammed into 2 rows (3+2 layout)
- **After**: Organized into 3 rows (2+2+1 layout) with better spacing
- Added proper vertical spacing (0.8cm between rows)

### 3. **Enhanced Figure Options**
- Added `height=0.75\textwidth` constraint to maintain aspect ratio
- Added `keepaspectratio` to prevent distortion
- Used `centering` for each subfigure for better alignment

### 4. **Better Page Placement**
- Changed from `[t]` (top) to `[p]` (full page) placement
- This gives the UMAP visualizations their own dedicated page for maximum visibility

### 5. **Improved Caption**
- Enhanced the main caption to better explain what readers should look for
- Added reference to the sampling methodology (1,000 randomly sampled pairs)
- Emphasized the progression showing "structural damage caused by fine-tuning"

### 6. **Added LaTeX Packages**
- Added `adjustbox` package for better figure positioning and scaling
- Added `afterpage` package for improved page placement
- Configured graphics path extensions for better image handling

### 7. **Removed Inconsistent Content**
- Removed stray "Statistical Validation" section that contradicted previous cleanup work
- Maintained consistency with the removal of fabricated statistical analyses

## Technical Details

### Before (Original Code):
```latex
\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{0.32\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{umap_visualization_sentence_transformers_all_MiniLM_L6_v2.png}
...
```

### After (Improved Code):
```latex
\begin{figure*}[p]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{0.48\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth, height=0.75\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{umap_visualization_sentence_transformers_all_MiniLM_L6_v2.png}
...
```

## Result
- ✅ UMAP visualizations are now **50% larger** (0.48 vs 0.32 textwidth)
- ✅ Better organized layout with **clear visual progression**
- ✅ Enhanced readability of embedding space changes
- ✅ Dedicated page placement for maximum impact
- ✅ Maintained academic formatting standards
- ✅ Successfully compiled with XeLaTeX
- ✅ All 5 UMAP images loaded correctly

## Files Modified
1. `Chapters/5.results.tex` - Improved UMAP visualization figure layout
2. `Chapters/4.methods.tex` - Removed inconsistent statistical validation section
3. `main.tex` - Added supporting LaTeX packages for better figure handling

The thesis now properly showcases your UMAP visualizations, making it much easier for readers to see and understand the progressive embedding space degradation that supports your key findings about fine-tuning failures on saturated benchmarks.
